<p>
My understanding of ESLint is that it is a code analysis tool which can be used within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to help identify and resolve problems in code. It is very useful in maintaining a certain level of code quality by enforcing coding conventions and finding potential errors that could lead to annoying bugs down the line.
