<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  I remember not too long ago in highschool, I would have two options when it came to getting help for certain subjects; I could either stay after school with my teacher and ask a few questions about what I didn’t understand on the homework, or I would wait until I got home from tennis practice, get onto a voice chat using Discord, and ask my friends how they approached the homework problems we had while they queued up for a Counter-Strike match. Only a handful of years have passed, but the landscape is a bit different. With the rapidly growing availability and integration of AI tools within our culture, and especially in education, there has been great discourse as to how it will affect the quality of student’s learning experience. I like the description of AI as a tool, because that is exactly how I’ve used it in ICS 314 - Software Engineering. While there may be more coding oriented tools available to use for software development, I mainly had experience using ChatGPT to aid in my conceptual understanding of the course materials.

<h3>Personal Experiene with AI</h3>
<p>
  My personal experience with AI in ICS 314 - Software Engineering mainly consists of using various models of ChatGPT. Within the span of one semester, ChatGPT went from 3, 3.5, and to 4 which showcases how incredibly quickly this technology is improving even in its infancy. 
</p>

<p>
  These are the various situations in which I had the opportunity to incorporate AI in my coursework, and how my experience of it was:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Experience WODs (Workouts of the Day)
    <ul>
      <li>Syntax related issues, declaring variables/functions, where to put curly braces vs. parentheses, etc</li>
      <li>I mainly followed the instructor’s walkthrough of the Experience WODs and used AI for things they may not have specifically covered</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    In-class Practice WODs
    <ul>
      <li>How to format Bootstrap5 components</li>
      <li>Styling HTML and Bootstrap5 components using CSS and classes</li>
      <li>Aligning componnets within the webpage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    Essays
    <ul>
      <li>Cleaning up sentence structure and grammar</li>
      <li>Getting ideas on how to structure/word my arguments clearly</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Final Project
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding the syntax and dependencies around schema.prisma and postgresql databases</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    <li>
    Learning a Concept / Tutorial
    <ul>
      <li>The concept of databases was abstract for me. I used AI quite a bit when trying to understand how to set up, access, and retrieve information from a postgres database. Using PGadmin4 as a way to visualize the information being stored in the database helped, but It would have been more difficult without being able to ask specific questions to ChatGPT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Answering a Question in Class or in Discord
    <ul>
      <li>Answering class discussion questions using ChatGPT. What are the pros and cons of using functional programming vs object oriented programming?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   <li>
    Asking or answering a smart-question
    <ul>
      <li>How to link a postgres database on PgAdmin4 to view its tables and data structures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
    <ul>

    </ul>
